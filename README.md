# Seatle-Airbnb
My first data analysis with Seatle Airbn dataset

## Introduction
This repo explores the **Seatle Airbnb** dataset and try to fidure out some interesting insight.

  *1. What's is the time the house/apartment is cheapest and most available?*
  
  *2. How is the price affected by other variables?*
  
  *3. Where should we go to get the cheaper price?*

## Files description

  1. listing.csv - The lising data file
  2. calendar.csv - The calendar data file
  3. Seatle Airbnb.ipynb - The notebook exploring the dataset and answer those question above

## Running

  Open [this notebook](https://github.com/thaihocnguyen-git/Seatle-Airbnb/blob/main/Seatle%20Airbnb.ipynb) and run the consquence cell
  ---
  The notebook include reading data, preprocess and analyze the three bussiness questions above. Beside, I tried to predict
  `price` in the listing dataset by using `LinearRegression` model. But the `r2_score` isn't good as expected(only about `0.18`).
  
## Futher work
  I'm going to do more preprocess before training the model and maybe choose the better set of features to train with.
